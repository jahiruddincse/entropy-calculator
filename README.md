# 🌡️ Web-based Entropy Calculator

A **web-based entropy calculator** with multiple tabs for different thermodynamics calculations.  
This project allows you to compute:

- **Phase Change Entropy**: ΔS = ΔH / T  
- **Heating Entropy**: ΔS = n · C · ln(T₂/T₁)  
- **Expansion Entropy**: ΔS = n · R · ln(V₂/V₁)  
- **Spontaneity**: ΔG = ΔH - TΔS  

The calculator is fully **interactive**, works in any browser, and is mobile-friendly.
